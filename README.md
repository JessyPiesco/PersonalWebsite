# PersonalCodePage
Welcome to my personal website! This site serves as a showcase of my skills, experience, and projects. As a passionate developer and self-proclaimed geek, I have created this website to share my journey in the world of coding and technology.

The website is built using JavaScript, React and Bootstrap, and features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. You can learn more about my background and interests in the About section, check out my projects (both finished and in progress) in the Portfolio section, and get in touch with me in the Contact section.

I hope you enjoy browsing through my website and getting to know me better. Thank you for visiting!
